# prework-study-guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn about three computer languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I built this project in order to get hands on experience writing code. I had never worked with these technologies prior to working on this project. I wanted to better understand how to code.

This project enabled me to create a central location for my notes on the prework for the bootcamp.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also learned how to use Github and about the importance of README.md files and how to write them. Finally I learned how to publish a webpage!
